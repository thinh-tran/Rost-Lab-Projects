\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data set of 131 individuals collected in Taiwan - samples including blood, stool and urine
	\item Goal: look for variance in protein abundance through their proteomes and correlate with the number of variance in the protein-coding genes
	\item Rationale: protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) have been identified but not much is known about genetic control of protein abundance (not directly related to mRNA level)
\end{itemize}
